I would defenately choose Big Bs over memphis or daves.  But being that dickies is closer I think ill just keep going there for my to-go orders but for a sit down meal I'd come here.  I stopped in and got the 2 meat plate.  As far as price goes it was on par with the other bbq joints in town.Walking in I was reminded of home.  Signs posted on the wall says they serve shiner.  If I was a beer drinker im sure I'd be happy.  Everyone was drinking shiner when I was younger.  Ordering was straightforward.  I ordered my standard or brisket and sausage.  Sides were potatoe salad and mac and cheese.Brisket was the way i like it Trimmed.  It had good smoke flavor and you could see a smoke ring.  It was a tad dry and didn't pass bend test.  Not the best brisket ever but far from the worst.Sauage i ordered was the jalape帽o cheese hot link.  It was tasty and spicy but not so hot you didn't want to finish. I didn't really notice any cheddar in the sausage and it kind of reminded me or a store bought link.The patatoe salad was ok.  A little too much stuff in it for me but maybe you like it that way.  And a little too much pepper?  It is NOT a mustard based potatoe salad because its a Texas joint so don't be surprised.Mac and cheese... again a bit heavy on the pepper and a little runny for my liking.Now for the rest... a little odd that a Texas bbq joint missed this.  Where was my sliced onion and pickle????????????  also whats with asking if I want wheat bread???  White bread only :).  Other than that it is what it is.\", '3']\n",
      "1 [\"United out of LAS is not to bad but since it is not a hub airport you usually have to hop somewhere else to get to your ultimate destination. The United Section is small but nice.  The gate area is on the tiny side and on a full flight can become slightly chaotic.  On this trip I was heading to Honolulu via LAX.  This was the standard commuter type plane with no amenities.  The Wifi although offered didn't work as usual.  This has been the norm with the last several United flights with Wifi.  The crew is clueless on how it works or what to do to get it to work.  So much for that revenue stream.    If new to United and taking a United flight soon below are a few tips.1.  If on a long domestic trip bring your own food.  What they offer isn't that good and or fulfilling.2.  Buy water or a soda - the service in coach is slow and not passenger friendly3.  If on a long international or domestic flight get economy plus.  If you don't schedule a deep tissue massage or chiropractic visit at your arrival city.  4.  If buying this cheapest ticket don't expect to find space in the overhead bins - save money and gate check your large hand carry item since it is free and faster than cheeked baggage.  5.  Have your own entertainment device even if they offer entertainment on the flight.  No guarantee it works and last minute plane changes could make for a boring flight.  Good luck and travel safe :)\", '3']\n",
